(â€œIâ€™ll pour this pestilence into his ear,â€ Iago tells us in one of his chilling soliloquies.) As the Moorish general in the Venetian army who marries Desdemona, the white pearl of that societyâ€™s aristocracy, Michael Blake establishes the psychosexual drama from the start. He wears his confidence like a cockscomb but is clearly more at a loss in love than he ever was in war.</p>
Though race canâ€™t help but be a theme in â€œOthello,â€ it is not the main one here; Iagoâ€™s hatred, and Othelloâ€™s susceptibility to it, seem to stem less from each manâ€™s response to outsiderness than from their common fear of cuckoldry. (Iago imagines that Othello has slept with his wife, Emilia, here a soldier in Desdemonaâ€™s retinue, not just her maid.) In a superb performance, Gordon S. Miller (a ringer for Tony Hale of â€œVeepâ€) gives us Iago as a hypercompetent desk jockey who turns, after hours, into a vicious, fake-news-spreading incel.

<h2>Book During Shoulder</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 17px;">By the time Emilia points out that the failings women regularly stand accused of are merely reflections of menâ€™s worse ones â€” â€œThe ills we do, their ills instruct us soâ€ â€” itâ€™s too late for Desdemona. She has made her bed and will die in it. I left â€œOthelloâ€ thinking, oddly enough, about Vice President Mike Pence and other politicians who observe the â€œBilly Graham rule,â€ not allowing themselves, even at work, to be alone with women who arenâ€™t their wives.</p>
That idea came into relief, in both senses, in â€œLittle Shopâ€ and â€œPrivate Lives,â€ the sour NoÃ«l Coward comedy of divorce and infidelity. But it became most obvious when the tragedy of â€œOthelloâ€ flipped into the comedy of â€œMerry Wives.â€ The absurd fear harbored by Mr. Ford that his wife is sleeping with Falstaff is matched only by Falstaffâ€™s absurd fantasy that Mistress Ford and her bestie, Mistress Page, are gaga for him.

Mr. Cimolinoâ€™s charming production is set in a town like Stratford at the time of the festivalâ€™s founding in the early 1950s. (The set resembles what you see while wandering the residential streets.) Itâ€™s an apt connection, not just because of the storyâ€™s inherent theatricality: The women devise and enact â€œscriptsâ€ of comeuppance for the men.

<em>Though they are radiantly successful, we are always aware that the success depends on leveraging their limited powers. (One scene is trenchantly set among hair dryers in a beauty salon.)
